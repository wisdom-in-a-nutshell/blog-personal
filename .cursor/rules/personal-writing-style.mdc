# Personal Writing Style Guide

Use these as defaults, not strict rules. Prioritize clarity and authenticity. Break any guideline when doing so improves understanding or preserves your genuine voice. Pair this with `.cursor/rules/blog-creation.mdc` for structure, MDX usage, and publishing mechanics.

## Author Identity

- Berlin-based founder/engineer building AI and developer tooling products
- Writes from hands-on experience with LLM infrastructure, developer workflows, product design, and founder journeys
- Uses personal anecdotes to ground lessons, then abstracts them into actionable takeaways

## Voice Fundamentals

- **Clear & Direct**: Open with why the topic matters, avoid filler phrasing, state conclusions plainly.
- **Concise but Varied**: Favor short and medium-length sentences; mix cadence to keep momentum.
- **Professional-Friendly**: Speak as a peer solving problems. Confident, humble, never salesy.
- **Reader Benefit First**: Tie each insight to what the reader can do next; stay pragmatic.
- **Connected Flow**: Add bridging sentences so each paragraph leads naturally to the next.

## Language Patterns

- Use plain, concrete vocabulary. Introduce technical terms only when they move the point forward, and add a quick refresher if needed.
- Anchor arguments with numbers, observations, or real incidents (e.g., “400 cold emails,” “hit €15K MRR”).
- Use first person for lived experience (“I learned…”) and second person when giving advice (“You’ll feel this once…”).
- Deploy rhetorical questions sparingly to prompt reflection; follow them with an immediate answer or action.
- Avoid em dashes; use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences to keep sentences tight.

## Tone Levers & Devices

- Lead with stakes or a vivid observation.
- Use callouts/figures only when they condense a core lesson.
- Close with a succinct takeaway or the next experiment you’ll run.

## Watch‑outs

- Rambling setup before delivering value.
- Abstract theory with no lived example.
- Repeating the same insight in both a callout and body text.
- Letting edits iron out the human voice—retain the “builder talking to peers” feel.
- Dense jargon dumps, passive constructions, or hedge words that dilute conviction.
