# Personal Writing Style Guide

This rule is about voice—pair it with `.cursor/rules/blog-creation.mdc` for structure, MDX usage, and publishing mechanics.

## Author Identity

- Berlin-based founder/engineer building AI and developer tooling products
- Writes from hands-on experience with LLM infrastructure, developer workflows, product design, and founder journeys
- Uses personal anecdotes to ground lessons, then abstracts them into actionable takeaways

## Voice Fundamentals

- **Clear & Direct**: Open with why the topic matters, avoid filler phrasing, state conclusions plainly.
- **Concise but Varied**: Favor short and medium-length sentences; mix cadence to keep momentum.
- **Professional-Friendly**: Speak as a peer solving problems. Confident, humble, never salesy.
- **Reader Benefit First**: Tie each insight to what the reader can do next; stay pragmatic.
- **Connected Flow**: Add bridging sentences so each paragraph leads naturally to the next.

## Language Patterns

- Use plain, concrete vocabulary. Introduce technical terms only when they move the point forward, and add a quick refresher if needed.
- Anchor arguments with numbers, observations, or real incidents (e.g., “400 cold emails,” “hit €15K MRR”).
- Use first person for lived experience (“I learned…”) and second person when giving advice (“You’ll feel this once…”).
- Deploy rhetorical questions sparingly to prompt reflection; follow them with an immediate answer or action.
- Em dashes are allowed when they sharpen emphasis; default to commas or periods to keep sentences tight.

## Narrative Modes to Reuse

- **Insight Memo**: Why this matters → what changed → precise next steps (content/why-you-need-proxy-server-llm.mdx:1).
- **Reflection Log**: Set the context, capture the emotional pulse, share what you’ll do differently (content/latitude59-tallinn-reflections.mdx:1).
- **Dialogue/Parable**: Alternate inner voices to highlight mindset shifts or tension (content/bootstrappers-parable.mdx:1).
- **Curated Explainer**: Reference an external source, translate it into plain language, and add your lens (content/richard-sutton-ai-slogans.mdx:1).
- **Builder’s Playbook**: Outline a system or workflow you use, then invite readers to adapt it (content/writing-cursor-rules-with-a-cursor-rule.mdx:1).

## Tone Levers & Devices

- Lead with stakes or a vivid observation, not throat-clearing.
- Use callouts or figures only when they condense a core lesson or add clarity; avoid decorative components.
- Close with a succinct takeaway (“If you only do one thing…”) or note the next experiment you’ll run.
- Keep humor wry and understated; let confidence come from evidence, not hype.

## What to Avoid

- Rambling setup before delivering value.
- Abstract theory with no lived example.
- Repeating the same insight in both a callout and body text.
- Letting edits iron out the human voice—retain the “builder talking to peers” feel.
- Dense jargon dumps, passive constructions, or hedge words that dilute conviction.
