          I write lessons I wish I'd known earlier. This blog helps me think clearly about hard
          problems and compress insights into principles I can actually use. I write for my younger
          self, but publishing sharpens my thinking and hopefully helps others skip some struggles.

        <h2>My AI Journey</h2>

        <p>
          In 2023, a friend expecting a baby told me about ChatGPT. He was using it for parenting
          questions and found it surprisingly helpful. This caught my attention because he never gets
          excited about new tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had zero AI training but spent 4 months experimenting with GPT-3.5 after work every day.
          Quickly realized this was the turning point I'd been waiting for. Quit my job to figure out
          how to be part of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first AI startup, "Wisdom in a Nutshell," failed after several months. Classic mistake:
          built a solution first, then looked for problems. For my current startup, A.I. Podcasting,
          I flipped it. Talked to podcasters first, understood their real challenges, then built what
          they actually needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today I'm an AI tinkerer, not a researcher. I experiment with tools to find practical
          applications rather than develop the underlying tech. I love blending technology with
          creativity to make complex processes simple.
        </p>


        <p>
          I'm building <a href="https://aipodcast.ing" target="_blank" className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">AI Podcasting</a> to help creators focus on storytelling while we handle the technical stuff. We streamline everything from audio enhancement to distribution.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog documents my journey learning to co-create with AI tools. We've passed the inflection pointâ€”participation isn't optional anymore.
        </p>
