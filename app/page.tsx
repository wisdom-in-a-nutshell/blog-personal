        <p>
          This is my personal blog where I document lessons I wish I'd known earlier. I've found my
          writing becomes clearer when I imagine an audience, and the audience I know best is
          myself. So, I write primarily for my younger self.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reflect deeply on challenging experiences, investing significant "thinking tokens" into
          understanding them. Writing helps me compress these insights into clear, actionable
          principles. These principles guide my future decisions, sharpen my thinking, and hopefully
          help others avoid similar struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from that, I spend most of my time deeply immersed in AI, which I believe marks a
          fundamental turning point in history. Here, I document my journey of learning how best to
          co-create with AI. I also explore how we can thoughtfully engage with this technology
          because the inflection point has already passed, and we have no choice but to participate.
          This blog is my voice in that ongoing conversation.
