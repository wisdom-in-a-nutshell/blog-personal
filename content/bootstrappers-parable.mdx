Quit job. Dive headfirst. Start first company with impostor syndrome.

Anxious Me: "What if I can't do this?"

Zen Me: "We'll see."

6 months in. No PMF. Shut it down.

Anxious Me: "I failed. I was right. I am not built for this brutal bootstrapped world."

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Decide to start something new. New zing and new energy.

Anxious Me: "This time it has to work."

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Great co‑founder joins. Late‑night ideation sessions, sparks of mutual vision.

Anxious Me: "This is awesome to build with someone who gets it!"

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Together we send 400 cold emails. Zero replies.

Anxious Me: "This is going nowhere."

Zen Me: "We'll see."

First dream client signs up. We are making mooooney!

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Trial clients demand free work, exploit our time, disrespect us.

Anxious Me: "I'm burning out. This is not sustainable."

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Hit €15K MRR.

Anxious Me: "PMF? Is this it? Two of us made money from internet from a random corner of the world from scratch!"

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Some clients churn out of nowhere.

Anxious Me: "We're back to square one?"

Zen Me: "We'll see."

Clients appear from referrals of our past good work.

Hopeful Me: "Maybe you are built for this?"

Zen Me: "We'll see."
