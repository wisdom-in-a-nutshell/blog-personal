## The Prompt

I saw this tweet and ran the prompt for 50 food chains:

<StaticTweet id="1995190286775881780" />

```
3D chibi-style miniature concept store of {Brand Name}, creatively designed
with an exterior inspired by the brand's most iconic product or packaging
(such as a giant {brand's core product}).

The store features two floors with large glass windows clearly showcasing
the cozy and finely decorated interior: {brand's primary color}-themed decor,
warm lighting, and busy staff dressed in outfits matching the brand.

Adorable tiny figures stroll or sit along the street, surrounded by benches,
street lamps, and potted plants, creating a charming urban scene.

Rendered in a miniature cityscape style using Cinema 4D, with a blind-box
toy aesthetic, rich in details and realism, and bathed in soft lighting
that evokes a relaxing afternoon atmosphere.

At the top-center, place the title "{Brand Name}" in large bold text matching
the brand's style.
```

Replace `{Brand Name}`, `{brand's core product}`, and `{brand's primary color}` for any brand you want.
