## The End of Chapter 2

Eighteen months into building AIP, I find myself at the end of Chapter 2. We have hit certain revenue metrics. My co-founder and I have built a solid working relationship. I know how to talk to clients now.

Chapter 3 is beginning. This reflection captures what I wish I had known when starting this journey.

If I had to summarize the big theme of Chapter 2, it would be this: known unfairness versus unknown unfairness. The goal is to figure out which is which as quickly as possible.

When you know the unfairness exists, you can work with it. You understand the game you are playing. The moment you know the rules, things become much easier. When you do not know, the journey becomes unnecessarily hard.

This applies especially to small bootstrap teams operating from countries not known for their startup ecosystems. These unfairnesses become more relevant when you are building from a corner office rather than Silicon Valley.

Here are the five biggest lessons I learned in Chapter 2.

## Distribution Beats Product Excellence

A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.

This topic gets discussed frequently among indie hackers and bootstrappers. It took me a long time to internalize this truth.

If you are the founder, your job is to work on distribution whether you like it or not. If you build a good product, you are almost obligated to work on distribution. The sooner you internalize this, the better.

There are excellent resources on how to approach distribution. The key insight is accepting this responsibility early. Many founders resist this because they prefer building to selling. The product will not sell itself, no matter how good it is.

Much of my focus in Chapter 3 will be on distribution. I should have started earlier.

## Personal Networks Matter More Than You Think

Your personal network acts as a force multiplier for everything you build. Every feature, every improvement, every piece of content gets amplified through the people you know.

Who you know matters. How you leverage those relationships is extremely important. This becomes especially true at the early stage when everything is harder.

Many would claim personal networks are not important. They say just focus on building a great product. This advice typically comes from exceptional founders at the extremes of success. I am an average founder, and average advice applies to me.

Building relationships before you need them makes everything easier. Your early clients, partnerships, and opportunities often come through your network. Much of your early momentum depends on tapping into these connections effectively.

If you are starting from zero, invest time in building genuine relationships. The returns compound over time.

## Navigate B2B Intermediaries Carefully

In B2B sales, there is often a difference between who you serve and who you sell to.

In an ideal world, these two people would be perfectly aligned. The person buying your service wants the same outcomes as the person using it. This rarely happens in practice.

You need to navigate the intermediary person who makes the buying decision. Part of your responsibility is making them look good within their organization. This means understanding their incentives and constraints.

The bottom line is simple: you need to close deals. But how you navigate these intermediary relationships often determines your success. Find strategies that work for both the end user and the decision maker.

This balance requires careful attention to organizational dynamics and politics.

## Protect Your Time Ruthlessly

Everybody, even those with the best intentions, will not respect your time as much as you think they should.

Time is the medium through which your energy, money, and ideas flow. As a small bootstrap founder, time becomes the biggest bottleneck. You need to be ruthless about protecting it.

This becomes especially challenging if you are prone to saying yes to every opportunity. You need to be selective about where you spend your time.

Most people have good intentions. They genuinely want to help or collaborate. But their priorities are not your priorities. As a founder, you need to find aligned strategies where collaboration works for everyone.

Guide conversations toward outcomes that serve your goals. Be polite but firm about boundaries.

## Avoid Early Pricing Anchors

In salary negotiations, your biggest leverage comes at the beginning when you are getting the job. After that, increments follow predictable patterns.

The same anchoring effect happens in B2B pricing, especially for small companies. Be careful at the early stage when you are desperate for clients. You might compromise on pricing to get those first customers.

There is a strong anchoring effect that can tie you down to what you initially charge. This creates a tricky balance. You want clients, but you also want to maintain pricing power.

I hope this does not happen to you. Be aware of this dynamic and do not undersell yourself early. You might get stuck serving clients at unsustainable rates.

The pricing you set early often becomes the ceiling for future negotiations.

## Looking Forward

These five lessons form the core of what I learned in Chapter 2. Understanding these unfairnesses earlier would have made the journey smoother.

The key insight is awareness. When you know the game you are playing, you can develop strategies to win. When you do not know, you waste time and energy fighting the wrong battles.

Chapter 3 will focus heavily on distribution and building systems that scale. The foundation is solid. Now comes the work of growing what we have built.

The journey continues.
