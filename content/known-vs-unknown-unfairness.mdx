It's been about 1.5 years since we started building this company.

We've hit some meaningful metrics, figured out the right direction, and my co-founder and I have found our rhythm.

It feels like one chapter of this entrepreneurial journey is wrapping up and another is beginning.

At these chapter transitions, I reflect on things I wish I'd known at the start. More for myself than anyone else.

I wrote similar reflections at the end of [Chapter 1 here](/blog/a-letter-early-2024-self). That was about figuring out which direction to walk.

Now this last chapter, Chapter 2, was about how to walk efficiently in that direction.

On reflecting, what I might do differently... I kept coming back to this idea of: **known versus unknown unfairness**.

"Unfairness" doesn't quite capture the contours and colors of what I'm trying to convey. But it's the closest equivalent I can think of. It's provocative enough to be catchy in my head without perverting the intended meaning.

When you know these things exist, you can work around it instead of blindly slumbering through them.

Also you tend to look around and see others gliding through the same challenges. It would seem unfair but its rather many (self-imposed) blind spots that you need to undo.

I'm not magically gliding now, but being aware of these patterns makes me much more deliberate going into Chapter 3.

So here are the six unfairnesses I wish I'd known:


1. **A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.**
2. **Who you know matters**
3. **Who you serve isn't who you sell to**
4. **Protect your time ruthlessly**
5. **Avoid early pricing anchors**
6. **People who ask for help get help**


## Distribution Beats Product Excellence

A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.

I've heard this a hundred times from indie hackers and bootstrappers. But it still took me a while to actually internalize it.

Nothing like lived experience to really understand something.

Plenty of excellent articles have been written about this, so I won't rehash that here and keep this brief.

People can't buy what they don't know exists.

If you build what you think is a great product, as the founder, you're obligated to show it to the right users.

Or at least that's what I've deluded myself into believing. So far, it's been a useful delusion.

If possible, build distribution into the product itself. In my case, it wasn't feasible.

So I'm actively splitting my time with hard boundaries: dedicated distribution time and dedicated product time.

## Who You Know Matters

Distribution gets your product seen so it can reach the right people who need your product.

Networks get you seen so you can reach the right people when you need help.

Who you know matters. It makes the journey easier.

But what about advice like "build a great product and network will emerge" or "build something so good they can't ignore it"?

Those are great pieces of advice for exceptional founders at the tail end of the spectrum.

I'm an average founder. I know who I am.

So yes, who you know matters.

Personally, I'd rather just sit at home, happily yap with my AI and code and build.

But when you're a bootstrapped founder, you're not only a craftsman. You're also a salesman. You're a marketer. You're a network builder.

You solve problems. And a good efficient way to solve problems is to have a network of people you can rely on, leverage, and get support from.

You don't have to reinvent a wheel all the time (although sometimes that path is deceptively seductive).

The best time to build relationships is before you need to "use" them.

## Who You Serve Isn't Who You Sell To

I think this applies to B2B in my limited experience. And not universally... but often enough to distill it as principle.

Who you sell your product to has different incentives than the person who the product/services is ultimately serving.

This creates tension.

Sometimes, you need to make the person who is buying your product look good to their boss (internally where they work). On other cases, your tool might disrupt their entire job or position—the thing they've been doing for years.

So they might resist, albeit in a convoluted way.

Some understanding of politics will help you understand what might seem like bewildering behavior for your engineering autistic brain.

This is frustrating if you just want to build great products.

But it's the game. You need to close deals. You need a way to serve the end user.

There are certain sacrifices you need to make. And appeasing this intermediary is one part of the game.

I'm still learning this game. I think eventually I don't want to deal with this at all. But for now, it is what it is.

## Avoid Early Pricing Anchors

Pricing your product/services is like salary negotiations for your jobs. Your biggest leverage is at the start. After that, you're anchored.

When you're desperate for those first clients, you'll be tempted to undercharge.

We landed early clients at rates that made sense when we had zero credibility. A year later, those same rates became weighing anchors.

If I had the confidence I have now (honestly, the product didn't change, just my belief in its value) I would have charged twice as much.

You need clients to build credibility, but you also need sustainable rates. Be aware of this dynamic—don't trap yourself with unsustainable rates early on.

## People who ask for help get help

This might seem pedantic to write it down like that, but it was probably the hardest one for me.

Part of my early life was shaped by a dysfunctional family of sorts. The thing about such challenges is you get this double-edged sword.

I learned to be very self-reliant. Much of my financial independence journey and doing this company in a bootstrapped way came from the drive not to depend on anyone.
Which has served me well in many ways, and I'm actually grateful for it.

But it's also created maladaptive behaviors. Through therapy, I realized there's a difference between healthy independence and cutting yourself off from help when you actually need it.

Also building things with other people is fun (when you find the right people).

It was a mental block I had to work through. But once I did, things got easier.


## Protect Your Time Ruthlessly

Energy, ideas, money, all flow through time. So once you have a working product, as a bootstrapped founder, time will likely become your single most important bottleneck.

My earlier instinct was to say yes to every opportunity (or meeting) that seemed good. Which served me well in Chapter 1.

But most opportunities take longer than you think. Now I am learning to be ruthless about this.

Have the courage to say no to good opportunities that don't align and have the "courage to be disliked". I now under-commit slightly and stay focused on the mission.

People actually respect you more for being clear about your boundaries.


## Looking Backward to Move Forward

Those are the things I wish I'd known earlier.

Chapter 3 starts now. I'm focusing on distribution and building systems that actually scale.
