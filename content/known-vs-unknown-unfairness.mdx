It's been about 1.5 years since we started building this company.

We've hit some meaningful metrics, figured out the right direction, and my co-founder and I have found our rhythm.

I'm not sure if it will all be a mega success, but it feels like one chapter of this entrepreneurial journey is closing and another is beginning.

This book is already longer than I anticipated, and I look forward to writing more chapters.

At these chapter transitions, I reflect on things I wish I'd known at the start. More for myself than anyone else. I write them down so I can use them again.

I wrote similar reflections at the end of [Chapter 1 here](/blog/a-letter-early-2024-self). That was about figuring out which direction to walk.

Now this last one, Chapter 2, was about how to walk efficiently in that direction.

Upon reflecting on the last few months, what I kept coming back to: **known versus unknown unfairness**.


After a few months, I realized I was stumbling through Chapter 2 very inefficiently.

The inefficiency came from being unaware of hidden drag coefficients. Things some people figure out early. When you see them gliding through the same challenges, it feels unfair.

When you know unfairness exists, you can work around it. When you don't, you waste energy fighting invisible obstacles.

I'm not magically gliding now, but being aware of these patterns makes me much more deliberate going into Chapter 3.

So here are the five unfairnesses I wish I'd known:


1. **Distribution beats product excellence**
2. **Who you know matters**
3. **Who you serve isn't who you sell to**
4. **Protect your time ruthlessly**
5. **Avoid early pricing anchors**


## Distribution Beats Product Excellence

A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.

I've heard this a hundred times from indie hackers and bootstrappers. But it still took me a while to actually internalize it.

Nothing like lived experience to really understand something.

Plenty of excellent articles have been written about this, so I won't rehash that here and keep this brief.

People can't buy what they don't know exists.

If you build what you think is a great product, as the founder, you're obligated to show it to the right users.

Or at least that's what I've deluded myself into believing. So far, it's been a useful delusion.

If possible, build distribution into the product itself. In my case, it wasn't feasible.

So I'm actively splitting my time with hard boundaries: dedicated distribution time and dedicated product time.

## Who You Know Matters

Distribution gets your product seen so it can reach the right people who need your product.

Networks get you seen so you can reach the right people when you need help.

Who you know matters. It makes the journey easier.

But what about advice like "build a great product and network will emerge" or "build something so good they can't ignore it"?

Those are great pieces of advice for exceptional founders at the tail end of the spectrum.

I'm an average founder. I know who I am.

So yes, who you know matters.

Personally, I'd rather just sit at home, happily yap with my AI and code and build.

But when you're a bootstrapped founder, you're not only a craftsman. You're also a salesman. You're a marketer. You're a network builder.

You solve problems. And a good efficient way to solve problems is to have a network of people you can rely on, leverage, and get support from.

The best time to build relationships is before you need to "use" them.

## Who You Serve Isn't Who You Sell To

This applies to B2B in my limited experience.

Who you sell your product to has different incentives than the person using your product. This creates tension.

Sometimes, you need to make the buyer look good to their boss.

In other cases, your tool might disrupt their entire job or position—the thing they've been doing for years. They might resist, albeit in a convoluted way.

Some understanding of politics will help you understand what might seem like bewildering behavior for your engineering autistic brain.

Otherwise, you'll keep banging your head doing the same straightforward thing over and over again.

This is frustrating if you just want to build great products.

But it's the game. You need to close deals. You need a way to serve the end user.

There are certain sacrifices you need to make. And appeasing this intermediary is one part of the game.

I'm still learning this game. I think eventually I don't want to deal with this at all. But for now, it is what it is.

## Protect Your Time Ruthlessly

As a bootstrapped founder, time is the medium through which everything else flows. Your energy, money, ideas. It will very likely be your single most important bottleneck.

My earlier instinct was to say yes to every opportunity that seemed good. Which served me well early on. You get that dopamine rush from saying yes and learning about new possibilities.

But there's only so much time in the day. Most things take longer than you think.

And here's the tricky part: most people don't come with an intention of wasting your time. They want to help or engage.

So part of the challenge is it's not black or white. You have a seemingly endless array of nice options. Your goal is to pick, prioritize, and find the win-win situations that fit best.

Eventually, I learned to be ruthless about this. You need to write down who you're serving and what your priorities are. I now under-commit slightly because reality always takes longer.

Whenever I wasn't deliberate about my time, when I got blown around by the wind, I couldn't make the best use of it anyway. It was the worst of all outcomes.

Maybe there will come a time I can glide with the wind. But not yet.


## Avoid Early Pricing Anchors

Pricing is like salary negotiations. Your biggest leverage is at the start. After that, you're anchored.

When you're desperate for those first clients, you'll be tempted to undercharge. We landed early clients at rates that made sense when we had zero credibility. A year later, those same rates became weighing anchors.

Clients remember what you charged them. They'll reference it in every future negotiation: "But you did this for X last time..."

If I had the confidence I have now (honestly, the product didn't change, just my belief in its value) I would have charged twice as much.

I'm still torn about this. You need clients to build credibility, but you also need sustainable rates. Be aware of this dynamic—don't trap yourself with unsustainable rates early on.


## Looking Backward to Move Forward

Knowing them earlier would have saved months of frustration.

The key insight: awareness changes everything. When you know unfairness exists, you can work around it. When you don't, you waste energy fighting invisible obstacles.

Chapter 3 starts now. I'm focusing on distribution and building systems that actually scale.

Time to continue writing this adventure book.
