It's been about 1.5 years since we started building this company.

Chapter 2 feels done. Chapter 3 is starting.

Quantitatively, we've hit some meaningful metrics (revenue and clients). We've figured out the right direction to walk. My co-founder and I seem to have found a rhythm walking together.

I'm not sure if it will all be a mega success.

But at least personally, this is a already a longer book than I anticipated.

And it personally looks like I'll be writing many more chapters and I look forward to it.

One thing I often do at these chapter transitions is reflect and look at the things I wish I had known at the start. I do this more for myself than anyone else. I write them down to distill them so I can use them again.

I was thinking about the overarching theme of this chapter of company building.

What I kind of came kept coming back to: known versus unknown unfairness.

"Unfairness" doesn't quite capture the contours and colors of what I'm trying to convey. But it's the closest equivalent I can think of. It's provcative enought to be catchy in my head without being too perversive in its meaning.

So what do I mean?

The first chapter of this journey was all about figuring out what is directionally correct among the many available laten paths of entrepreneurship.

The second chapter was about how to move in this direction in the most efficient way possible. After a few months into this journey, it felt the journey was getting a bit too slow and inefficient.

So the big learning from this chapter is known unfairness versus unknown unfairness. This is more relevant when you're small, bootstrapped, and working in a corner of the world, trying to build something unconventional like a business.


## Distribution Beats Product Excellence

A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.

I've heard this a hundred times from indie hackers and bootstrappers. But it took me a while to internalize it.

Nothing like live actual experience to really understand something.

Plenty of excellent articles have been written about this, so I'll skip the theory and keep this brief.

People can't buy what they don't know exists.

If you build what you think is a great product, as the founder, it's your obligation to that product that should show it to the right users.

Or at least that's what I've deluded myself into believing. And so far, it looks like a good delusion to live in and it has worked.



## Who You Know Matters

Who you know matters. It makes your work easier.

Most of my connections happened because people knew what I was doing.

But what about advice like "build a great product and network will emerge" or "build something so good they can't ignore it"?

Those are great pieces of advice for exceptional founders at the tail end of the spectrum.

I'm an average founder. I know who I am. So yes, who you know matters.

Your early clients come through your network. People you rely on for help, advice, or to avoid typical failure modesâ€”they come from your network too.

The best time to build relationships is before you need to "use" them. The returns compound over time.

## who you serve isn't who you sell to

proably not very atcively clear to me. i wish worl was straight foreard. applies to b2b.

The person writing the check has different incentives than the person using your product. This creates tension.

Your job isn't just solving the end user's problem. You need to make the buyer look good to their boss. You need to understand their constraints, their politics, their fears.

This is frustrating if you just want to build good products. But it's the game.

The bottom line: you need to close deals. How you navigate these relationships often determines whether you succeed or not.

## Protect Your Time Ruthlessly

As a bootstrapped founder, you quickly realize time is the medium through which everything else flows.

Your energy, money, ideas.

It will very likely be your chief bottleneck.

Even people with good intentions won't understandably know the priorities of your time.

I learned to be ruthless about this.

My earlier instinct was to say yes to every opportunity or seemingly potential opportunity that might be good.

Which actually served me well in the early days. But it's not the right fit now.

It's increasingly hard. Things are not black or white. These aren't choices you necessarily want to make.

But whenever I wasn't deliberate about my time, when I got blown around by the wind, I couldn't make the best use of it anyway. It was worst of all.

Maybe there will come a time I can glide with the wind. But not yet.


## Avoid Early Pricing Anchors

Pricing is like salary negotiations. Your biggest leverage is at the start. After that, you're anchored.

When you're desperate for those first clients, you'll be tempted to undercharge.

We landed early clients at rates that made sense when we had zero credibility. A year later, those same rates became weighing anchors.

I'm still torn about this. You need clients to build credibility, but you also need sustainable rates.


## Looking Backward Forward

Knowing them earlier would have saved months of frustration.

The key insight: awareness changes everything. When you know the game's rules, you can play to win. When you don't, you waste energy fighting the wrong battles.

Chapter 3 starts now. The focus shifts to distribution and building systems that scale.

Time to continue writing this adventure book.
