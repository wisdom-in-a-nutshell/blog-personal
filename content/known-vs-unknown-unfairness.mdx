It's been about 1.5 years since we started building this company.

Chapter 2 feels done. Chapter 3 is starting.

Quantitatively, we've hit some meaningful metrics (revenue and clients). We've figured out the right direction to walk. My co-founder and I seem to have found a rhythm walking together.

I'm not sure if it will all be a mega success.

But at least personally, this is a already a longer book than I anticipated.

And it personally looks like I'll be writing many more chapters and I look forward to it.

One thing I often do at these chapter transitions is reflect and look at the things I wish I had known at the start. I do this more for myself than anyone else. I write them down to distill them so I can use them again.

I was thinking about the overarching theme of this chapter of company building.

What I kind of came kept coming back to: known versus unknown unfairness.

"Unfairness" doesn't quite capture the contours and colors of what I'm trying to convey. But it's the closest equivalent I can think of. It's provocative enough to be catchy in my head without perverting the meaning.

So what do I mean?

The first chapter of this journey was all about figuring out what is directionally correct among the many available laten paths of entrepreneurship.

The second chapter was about how to move in this direction in the most efficient way possible. After a few months into this journey, it felt the journey was getting a bit too slow and inefficient.

So the big learning from this chapter is known unfairness versus unknown unfairness. This is more relevant when you're small, bootstrapped, and working in a corner of the world, trying to build something unconventional like a business.


## Distribution Beats Product Excellence

A decent product with exceptional distribution will beat an exceptional product with decent distribution.

I've heard this a hundred times from indie hackers and bootstrappers. But it took me a while to internalize it.

Nothing like live actual experience to really understand something.

Plenty of excellent articles have been written about this, so I won't rehash that here and keep this brief.

People can't buy what they don't know exists.

If you build what you think is a great product, as the founder, it's your obligation to that product that should show it to the right users.

Or at least that's what I've deluded myself into believing. And so far, it looks like a good delusion for this period of company building and it has worked.


## Who You Know Matters

Who you know matters. It makes the journey easier. Getting clients, connections, and getting help to get unstuck.

But what about advice like "build a great product and network will emerge" or "build something so good they can't ignore it"?

Those are great pieces of advice for exceptional founders at the tail end of the spectrum.

I'm an average founder. I know who I am.

So yes, who you know matters.

Personally, I'd rather just sit at home, happily yap with my AI and code and build.

But when you're a bootstrapped founder, you're not only a craftsman. You're also a salesman. You're a marketer. You're a network builder.

You solve problems. And a good efficient way to solve problems is to have a network of people you can rely on, leverage, and get support from.

I've seen Twitter threads about people building one tool and scaling it without networking. But that's often the exception.

Company building requires network building.

In our case, some of our early clients came through our network. The help we needed came through people we knew.

The best time to build relationships is before you need to "use" them.

## Who You Serve Isn't Who You Sell To

This applies to B2B in my limited experience.

Who you sell your product to has different incentives than the person using your product. This creates tension.

Sometimes, you need to make the buyer look good to their boss. In other cases, your tool might disrupt their entire job or positionâ€”the thing they've been doing for years. They might resist, albeit in a convoluted way.

Some understanding of politics will help you understand what might seem like bewildering behavior for your engineering autistic brain.

Otherwise, you'll keep banging your head doing the same straightforward thing over and over again.

This is frustrating if you just want to build good products. But it's the game.

The bottom line: you need to close deals. You need a way to serve the end user. There are certain sacrifices you need to make.

I'm still learning this game. I think eventually I don't want to deal with this at all. But for now, it is what it is.

## Protect Your Time Ruthlessly

As a bootstrapped founder, time is the medium through which everything else flows. Your energy, money, ideas. It will very likely be your single most important bottleneck.

My earlier instinct was to say yes to every opportunity that seemed good. Which served me well early on. You get that dopamine rush from saying yes and learning about new possibilities.

But there's only so much time in the day. Most things take longer than you think. And here's the tricky part: most people don't come with an intention of wasting your time. They want to help or engage. It's just that priorities don't align.

The challenge is it's not black or white. You have a seemingly endless array of nice options. Your goal is to pick, prioritize, and find the best win-win situations.

Eventually, I learned to be ruthless about this, although it hurts. You need to write down who you're serving and what your priorities are. I now under-commit slightly because reality always takes longer.

Whenever I wasn't deliberate about my time, when I got blown around by the wind, I couldn't make the best use of it anyway. It was the worst of all outcomes.

Maybe there will come a time I can glide with the wind. But not yet.


## Avoid Early Pricing Anchors

Pricing is like salary negotiations. Your biggest leverage is at the start. After that, you're anchored.

When you're desperate for those first clients, you'll be tempted to undercharge.

We landed early clients at rates that made sense when we had zero credibility. A year later, those same rates became weighing anchors.

I'm still torn about this. You need clients to build credibility, but you also need sustainable rates.


## Looking Backward Plus Forward

Knowing them earlier would have saved months of frustration.

The key insight: awareness changes everything. When you know the game's rules, you can play to win. When you don't, you waste energy fighting the wrong battles.

Chapter 3 starts now. The focus shifts to distribution and building systems that scale.

Time to continue writing this adventure book.
