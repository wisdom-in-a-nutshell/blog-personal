## The AI Has Amnesia Problem

I spend most of my coding time in Cursor. It's a fantastic tool.

But LLMs have a specific quirk: they possess strong **contextual memory** but lack **episodic memory**.

Or in simpler word, they remember (almost) within a single conversation (the context) but forget everything once a new chat session begins (no memory of past episodes).

Think of it like working with a brilliant assistant who has amnesia. Every single day, you have to explain the basics again.

- "Remember, we use camelCase here."
- "Our shared utilities go in the `lib` folder in specific folder structure."
- "This is how the backend API expects requests."

If you use Cursor often, this should sound very familiar. And you've likely same variations fo the above yourself. You nudge the AI back towards your project's standards or your personal preferences again and again.

## My Approach: Why, How, Then What

My philosophy is simple: understand _why_ a problem exists and _how_ a solution works, and the _what_ (the specific implementation) becomes much clearer. You'll likely even devise better solutions than I could suggest.

If you're already convinced you need a better way to manage AI consistency in Cursor and just want the practical trick, feel free to jump straight to the section on [How to Create Rules Without the Friction](#how-to-create-rules-without-the-friction).

For everyone else, let's first dive deeper into _why_ this is necessary.

## Why You Need Systems for AI

When working with intelligent people, you build systems. Style guides, process documents, checklists. These ensure everyone works consistently and effectively.

Now we work with intelligent _systems_ – AI. They need systems too, especially because of that amnesia problem.

For quick, throw-away scripts, consistency might not matter much. But for real applications built over time, it's crucial. You waste valuable time re-explaining:

- Coding conventions
- Folder structures
- Architectural patterns
- API interfaces
- Your preferred style

You need a way to instantly bring the AI up to speed.

Without a system to give the AI this long-term memory, you'll keep wasting time on repetitive explanations. Fortunately, Cursor provides a built-in way to create exactly these kinds of systems. Let's look at _what_ that solution is.

## What Are Cursor Rules? The System for Cursor AI

This is where Cursor Rules come in. They are essentially permanent instruction documents for the AI within your Cursor projects.

Think of them as the solution to the AI's episodic memory gap. They act as a knowledge base, teaching the AI your project's specific patterns and preferences. When Cursor sees a file matching a rule's pattern, it loads that knowledge. This creates consistency every time you chat with the AI in that project.

Having these rules ensures the AI consistently follows your project's standards. We've covered the _why_ (avoiding amnesia) and the _what_ (Cursor Rules). But the _how_ – the process of actually writing these rules – often presents its own challenge. Let's tackle that next.

## How to Create Rules Without the Friction

Okay, so rules are important. The "How" seems simple: read the Cursor documentation and write some `.mdc` files.

But let's be honest. Many developers _understand_ the benefits but hesitate because creating rules feels like extra work. It adds friction.

Here's a practical tip to overcome that friction: **Use AI to write the rules for itself.**

How? By creating a **meta-cursor rule**.

This is just a fancy way of saying you create _one_ rule that acts as a template or guide for writing _all other_ rules. It codifies the structure and content you want your rules to have.

Once you have this meta-rule, the process becomes easy:

1.  Notice a pattern you want to codify.
2.  Open the Cursor chat.
3.  Point the AI to your meta-rule (e.g., "Using the `cursor-rule-creation.mdc` guide...").
4.  Ask it to write a new rule based on the pattern or even a recent chat conversation ("...write a rule for our component structure based on this chat.").

The AI uses your meta-rule template to generate a well-structured draft. Save it, and you're done. This drastically lowers the effort needed to build your rule library.

### My Meta-Rule Template Structure

Creating your own meta-rule is straightforward.

1.  Create a `.cursor/rules` directory in your project root (if it doesn't exist).
2.  Create a file inside, perhaps named `cursor-rule-creation.mdc`.
3.  Define the structure you want your rules to follow.

Here's a simplified structure I use in my meta-rule:

```mdc
---
title: Brief Title of the Rule
description: Guidelines for what this rule covers
glob: 'pattern/to/match/relevant/files/**/*.{ext}'
alwaysApply: false # Or true, depending on the rule
---

# Rule Title

## 1. Introduction / Problem

- What problem does this rule solve?
- Why is this pattern important?
- When should this rule be applied?

## 2. The Pattern / Solution

- Clear explanations.
- Code examples (`tsx`, `python`, etc.).
- Key components involved.
- Links to *real* example files in the codebase if possible.

## 3. Implementation Steps (If Applicable)

- Step-by-step guide.
- Ordered list format.

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- What often goes wrong?
- How to spot the issues?
- How to fix or avoid them?
```

Customize this structure to fit your needs.

## Building Systems Pays Off

Meta-cursor rules are about building systems for your AI interactions. You teach the AI how to create its own documentation. This creates a self-improving cycle that boosts consistency and saves you time.

The small upfront investment in creating _one_ meta-rule pays off significantly. You'll spend less time repeating instructions and more time building.

Here's my full meta-rule file for reference:
