# Publishing Cadence Demo

This draft shows how a precomputed cadence dataset renders with our new shadcn/Recharts integration. The chart data is synthetic, but it mirrors the buckets defined in the ‚ÄúPublish Cadence Story‚Äù brief.

<Callout emoji="üß™">
  The chart below is wired through `PublishCadenceChart` and loads a client bundle only
  for the visualization. Everything else in the MDX stays server-rendered.
</Callout>

<PublishCadenceChart />

## What to Validate

- The chart inherits Tailwind tokens (light/dark backgrounds, typography).
- Tooltips show bucket names and counts while using the shared `ChartTooltipContent`.
- Card + chart components can be reused by other cadence-related posts or dashboards.

Once the real CLI pipeline is ready, swap the synthetic array for the exported JSON structure and keep the component API unchanged.
