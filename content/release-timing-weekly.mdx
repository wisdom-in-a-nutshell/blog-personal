I’m continuing a series on the patterns the top shows follow.

Here’s what we’ve covered so far:
- [How often the top shows publish](/blog/top-podcast-cadence)
- [How long their episodes run](/blog/how-long-top-podcasts-run)
- [Who hosts these top podcasts](/blog/who-hosts-top-podcasts)

The next basic question is timing: on which weekday do these shows release new episodes?

To keep the analysis clean, I’m looking only at the shows that publish weekly (for details, see the [previous post](/blog/top-podcast-cadence)).

How this post works:
- First I show the results.
- Then the key takeaways.
- Then a short methodology section if you want to know more about the data and analysis.
 - Find a link to the raw JSON at the bottom if you want to explore or reproduce the results.



## Results

### When do weekly shows release?

<ReleaseWeekdayChart />

<ReleaseWeekdayTable />

What stands out:
- Of the top 1,000 shows, 582 weekly shows with ≥5 dated recent episodes were evaluated.
- Releases cluster on Monday–Wednesday; Thursday follows. Weekends are rare.
- Split by weekday: Tue 22.5%, Mon 22.3%, Wed 21.3%, Thu 15.5%, Fri 12.0%, Sun 4.3%, Sat 2.1%.

### How consistent are they on that day?

Weekly shows sometimes miss their usual release day.
We capture this with a stability band: the share of recent episodes that land on the weekday a show posts most often.

<ReleaseStabilityChart />

<ReleaseStabilityTable />


What the bands mean, in plain terms:
- 308 shows (52.9%) hit the same weekday at least four out of five times (≥80%).
- 86 shows (14.8%) land there most of the time (60 to 79%).
- 158 shows (27.1%) are looser (40 to 59%).
- 30 shows (5.2%) are highly irregular (under 40%).

## Key takeaways

- If you publish weekly and want reliability, aim for a Monday–Wednesday release (Thursday also common). The key is the discipline to keep hitting it.
- Your audience and downstream workflows (clips, newsletter, social) benefit from a predictable rhythm.

## Method (short)

In case you want to reproduce the analysis yourself, here's the methodology:

- Cohort: Top 1,000 shows by audience; keep only weekly‑cadence shows.
- For each show, consider up to the last 40 episodes (require ≥5 dated).
- For each show, find the weekday it posts most often (UTC).
- Measure stability as the share of recent episodes that land on that same weekday.
- Aggregate shows into weekday counts and stability bands.

Notes
- 95.5% of evaluated shows used the full 40‑episode window; 4.5% had fewer dated episodes (min 5; mean 39.14).
- Weekday is computed from UTC timestamps for consistency across shows.
