I’m continuing a series on the patterns the top shows follow.

Here’s what we’ve covered so far:
- [How often the top shows publish](/blog/top-podcast-cadence)
- [How long their episodes run](/blog/how-long-top-podcasts-run)
- [Who hosts these top podcasts](/blog/who-hosts-top-podcasts)

The next basic question is timing: on which weekday do these shows drop new episodes?

To keep the analysis clean, I’m looking only at the shows that publish weekly (for details, see the [previous post](/blog/top-podcast-cadence)).

How this post works:
- First I show the results.
- Then the key takeaways.
- Then a short methodology section if you want to know more about the data and analysis.
- Then I include a link to the raw JSON data so you can explore the data yourself.

## Results

### When do weekly shows release?

<ReleaseWeekdayChart />

<ReleaseWeekdayTable />

What stands out:
- Of the top 1,000 shows, 582 publish weekly.
- Most weekly shows release on a weekday.
- Specifically, they seem to cluster on Monday to Wednesday, with Thursday is close behind.
- Weekends are rare.
- Out of 582 evaluated weekly shows, the split is: Tue is the highest with 22.5% of the shows releasing on that day, followed by Mon with 22.3%.

### How consistent are they on that day?

Apart from the actual calculation, which is important, I observed that a weekly show publishing on Monday doesn't always publish on Monday. There can be some variance.

I computed something called a stability band, which shows how consistent they are on that day.

<ReleaseStabilityChart />

<ReleaseStabilityTable />


What the bands mean, in plain terms:
- 308 shows (52.9%) hit the same weekday at least four out of five times (≥80%).
- 86 shows (14.8%) land there most of the time (60 to 79%).
- 158 shows (27.1%) are looser (40 to 59%).
- 30 shows (5.2%) are highly irregular (under 40%).

## What this means for you

- If you publish weekly and want reliability, aim for a Monday to Wednesday release, with Thursday also a strong choice.
- Also important is the discipline to keep hitting it.
- Your audience and downstream work streams (clips, newsletter, social) benefit from a predictable rhythm.

## Methodology

In case you want to reproduce the analysis yourself, here's the methodology:

- Cohort: Top 1,000 shows by audience; keep only weekly‑cadence shows.
- For each show, consider up to the last 40 episodes (require ≥5 dated).
- For each show, find the weekday it posts most often (UTC).
- Measure stability as the share of recent episodes that land on that same weekday.
- Aggregate shows into weekday counts and stability bands.
