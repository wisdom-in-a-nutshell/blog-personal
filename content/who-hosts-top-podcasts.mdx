While working on my last two posts on [how often big shows publish](/blog/top-podcast-cadence) and [how long their episodes run](/blog/how-long-top-podcasts-run), I had to look at thousands of RSS feeds. I started noticing some patterns in the URLs and got curious.

So, I decided to do a much more formal analysis to figure out this question: who are the hosting providers for all these top shows?

The results were pretty surprising. In this post, I'll show you:
- The hosting data for the top 1,000 and top 10,000 shows.
- The key patterns that stood out to me.
- The methodology I used, which got interesting because I found some quirks in how these feeds are structured.

### Feed hosts — Top 10,000 shows

## My Key Takeaways

- **The "Graduation" Story.** Looking at the top 10,000 shows, the indie platforms are giants. Libsyn is huge (14.5%!). But when you zoom into just the top 1,000, its share is cut in half (7.7%). It looks like shows start on these fantastic, indie-friendly platforms, but once they become commercial powerhouses, they seem to 'graduate' to an enterprise stack. My guess is they start needing more advanced features like team management and dynamic ad insertion.

- **The Rise of the Enterprise Hosts.** Before doing this analysis, I wasn't even that familiar with Omny Studio and ART19. But it turns out their share *doubles* when you go from the top 10k to the top 1k. It was a surprise to see them so strong at the very top, which points to how important that enterprise feature set becomes.

- **Megaphone's "Invisible" Dominance.** I was aware of Megaphone, but I was shocked by its dominance (28.9% of the top 1k). The real story is even bigger. Many shows that *look* self-hosted (with a branded URL like `feeds.npr.org`) are actually using Megaphone on the backend to deliver the audio. They get the brand control of a custom URL, but still use Megaphone's powerful ad tech. It's a really clever strategy.

- **Spotify/Anchor's Disappearing Act.** Given how many new shows start on Anchor, I expected to see more of them in the top 1k. But their share just craters at the very top. My theory? Anchor is an amazing, frictionless launchpad. It’s probably the best place to start. But once a show gets serious traction and wants to tap into the broader ad market beyond Spotify's walls, it seems they often pack their bags for a host with more flexible monetization.

## Methodology (My Detective Work)

My methodology had a few layers to get the real story.

1.  First, I did the easy part: classifying feeds from obvious URLs like `feeds.simplecast.com`.
2.  But for the tricky ones (custom domains or weird URLs), I did what I call an "enclosure sniff." I peeked inside the RSS file to find the URL for the actual audio file. This let me separate the **brand** (the RSS feed) from the **engine** (the audio delivery platform).
3.  For the charts you see, I also intentionally "clubbed" some categories like self-hosted sites and old feed managers into 'Other' so you can see the market share of the major commercial platforms more clearly.

## Examples (So You Can Double-Check Me)

### Straight-shot mappings

- `https://feeds.simplecast.com/dxZsm5kX` → Simplecast
- `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/stupid-genius` → Megaphone
- `https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/.../podcast.rss` → Omny
- `https://rss.art19.com/armchair-expert` → ART19
- `https://feeds.libsyn.com/580095/rss` → Libsyn

### Proxy or analytics relay, but still clear

- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/aad407/feeds.megaphone.fm/views-podcast` → Megaphone
- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/5ee0be/feeds.acast.com/public/shows/67894eae7095d15b31e3f226` → Acast
- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/e6441b/www.omnycontent.com/.../podcast.rss` → Omny
- `https://podcastfeeds.nbcnews.com/HL4TzgYC` → First-party RSS (NBC News)
- `https://feeds.publicradio.org/public_feeds/marketplace` → First-party RSS (APM)

### Needed the enclosure sniff

- *Quick refresher:* the `<enclosure>` tag in an RSS feed points to the actual media file, so the host that serves it tells us who delivers the audio.

- `https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/rss.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.npr.org/510318/podcast.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.npr.org/344098539/podcast.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://rss.wbur.org/circleround/podcast` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.publicradio.org/public_feeds/marketplace` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone

## What's next

This data opened up a lot of new questions for me. I'm not sure what I'll dig into next—maybe cross-referencing hosting with episode length, or maybe something else entirely. The deeper I go, the more interesting the patterns get.
