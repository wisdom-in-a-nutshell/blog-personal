After mapping [how often big shows publish](/blog/top-podcast-cadence) and [how long their episodes run](/blog/how-long-top-podcasts-run), the next obvious question was: **who actually hosts their RSS feeds?** We ran that probe across the same dataset.

Two quick takeaways before the charts:

- Megaphone’s lead grows the closer you zoom into the very top shows, while Libsyn still owns a big chunk of the broader top 10k.
- First-party RSS hasn’t disappeared. Roughly 1 in 10 of the very top shows still serves feeds from their own domains.

## Results

### Feed hosts — Top 1,000 shows

### Feed hosts — Top 10,000 shows

Each donut keeps the largest platforms separate and bundles the rest so you can see the split at a glance.

**What stood out to me:**

- Megaphone is the gravity well at the top (28.9% of the 1k cohort) and it still shows up even when publishers run their own feeds—22 of the self-hosted feeds deliver audio from Megaphone behind the scenes.
- Libsyn and Buzzsprout fade quickly once you look at the highest-audience shows. They’re still crucial for the long tail, but the big commercial pods migrate to the enterprise stack.
- Spotify/Anchor’s footprint collapses at the top 1k. The shows that do break through seem to move to other hosts once the audience ramps.

## Why it matters for us

This is the plumbing we have to navigate for the “record & relax” promise. Knowing which host (and which CDN) sits behind a feed lets us script handoffs, drop in the right intake links, and skip a bunch of back-and-forth when a creator is migrating. It also means the automations we’re shipping stay aware of which analytics proxies or delivery networks might rewrite URLs on their way out.

## Methodology

Same cohort as the last two posts: top shows by audience from the PodSeeker dataset. For each feed we:

1. Classified the hosting platform from the RSS URL (host and path rules).
2. When the URL looked first-party or wrapped in a proxy, we fetched up to 200 KB, grabbed the first `<enclosure>` URL, and mapped the audio delivery host separately.

We ignored anything slower than monthly cadence for this pass because the sample is tiny and the feed counts don’t move much there.

## Examples (so you can double-check us)

### Straight-shot mappings

- `https://feeds.simplecast.com/dxZsm5kX` → Simplecast
- `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/stupid-genius` → Megaphone
- `https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/.../podcast.rss` → Omny
- `https://rss.art19.com/armchair-expert` → ART19
- `https://feeds.libsyn.com/580095/rss` → Libsyn

### Proxy or analytics relay, but still clear

- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/aad407/feeds.megaphone.fm/views-podcast` → Megaphone
- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/5ee0be/feeds.acast.com/public/shows/67894eae7095d15b31e3f226` → Acast
- `https://rss.pdrl.fm/e6441b/www.omnycontent.com/.../podcast.rss` → Omny
- `https://podcastfeeds.nbcnews.com/HL4TzgYC` → First-party RSS (NBC News)
- `https://feeds.publicradio.org/public_feeds/marketplace` → First-party RSS (APM)

### Needed the enclosure sniff

- *Quick refresher:* the `<enclosure>` tag in an RSS feed points to the actual media file, so the host that serves it tells us who delivers the audio.

- `https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/rss.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.npr.org/510318/podcast.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.npr.org/344098539/podcast.xml` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://rss.wbur.org/circleround/podcast` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone
- `https://feeds.publicradio.org/public_feeds/marketplace` → First-party RSS; enclosure points to Megaphone

## What's next

Next up, I want to cross-tab this with cadence and episode length. If you’re curious about a specific show or platform, hit me up—I’m planning to publish the full show-level explorer once I finish cleaning the proxy labels.
