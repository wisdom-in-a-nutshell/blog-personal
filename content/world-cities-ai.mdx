## The Inspiration

<StaticTweet id="1995828737758105846" />

I stumbled upon this tweet showcasing a beautiful isometric 3D miniature city illustration with weather overlays. The aesthetic immediately caught my attention—soft textures, realistic PBR materials, and gentle lighting creating an immersive atmosphere.

The prompt was too good not to experiment with:

> Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [CITY], featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.
>
> Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.
>
> At the top-center, place the title "[CITY]" in large bold text, a prominent weather icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text). All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops of the buildings.

So I did what any curious developer would do—I automated it.

## What I Built

A Python script that:

1. Takes a list of world cities
2. Fetches current weather data for each city
3. Generates an isometric 3D illustration using GPT-4o image generation
4. Uploads the result to cloud storage

The script runs through cities from New York to Tokyo, from Johannesburg to Stockholm, generating unique illustrations that reflect each city's landmarks and current weather.

## The Script

I've published the full script as a GitHub Gist. Feel free to fork and modify it for your own experiments:

**[View the Python script on GitHub Gist →](https://gist.github.com/)**

_Note: You'll need your own OpenAI API key and cloud storage credentials to run it._

## Key Observations

**What works well:**
- The isometric perspective is remarkably consistent across all cities
- Iconic landmarks are usually recognizable (Eiffel Tower, Burj Khalifa, Sydney Opera House)
- Weather integration adds character—rainy London vs sunny Dubai feels right
- The soft color palette makes these genuinely pleasant to look at

**What's quirky:**
- Some cities get more "generic skyline" treatment
- Weather text positioning varies more than I'd like
- Occasionally the model invents landmarks that don't exist

## Try It Yourself

The prompt is the real star here. Even without the automation script, you can paste this into ChatGPT with GPT-4o and generate your own city illustrations:

```
Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [YOUR CITY], featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.

Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.

At the top-center, place the title "[YOUR CITY]" in large bold text, a prominent weather icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text). All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops of the buildings.
```

Replace `[YOUR CITY]` with any city name and watch the magic happen.
