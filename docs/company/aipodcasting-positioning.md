# AIPodcasting Positioning & Voice Notes

This background brief captures the essentials from the internal AIPodcasting positioning work so we can keep company-related posts aligned without digging through personal vault notes. It is purely context—keep writing in your usual personal style and lean on `.cursor/rules/personal-writing-style.md` for voice guidance.

## Ideal Customers
- **High-leverage creator-operators.** Hosts with established audiences who own the creative vision and want to keep control of their workflow.
- **Time-starved, quality-obsessed.** They publish regularly, value polish, and are willing to invest money to reclaim time.
- **Prefer a lean team.** They would rather not hire or manage a bench of freelancers just to keep episodes shipping.

Keep the language focused on outcomes that matter to this group: reliable cadence, premium output, and minimal coordination overhead.

## Positioning Pillars
These are the narrative anchors to weave into copy, decks, or visuals. They come directly from the 10-step positioning exercise.

1. **Record & Relax Experience**  
   - Promise: “You record. We handle the rest.”  
   - Proof points: drag-and-drop intake, automated status tracking, no back-and-forth for edits.  
   - Value: time saved, predictable turnaround, peace of mind.

2. **Your Podcast, Your Way, At Scale**  
   - Promise: bespoke quality without the drag of a traditional agency.  
   - Proof points: adaptive AI system that learns preferences, 80/20 automation with human polish, consistency with the host’s voice.  
   - Value: unique show identity stays intact while shipping more content.

## Competitive Context (Talk Track)
- Traditional agencies = trusted but slow, coordination-heavy, and expensive for iteration.
- Freelancer patchworks = flexible but fragile; founders become the bottleneck.
- In-house hires = quality control, but hard to scale beyond one show and require ongoing management.
- DIY tools (Descript, CapCut, Riverside, etc.) = great for hobbyists, not for our ICP’s volume and quality bar.

Use this comparison to frame AIPodcasting as the “embedded production partner” that blends agency-level craft with software speed.

## How to Use This Brief
- Reference these notes whenever you need a refresher on who AIPodcasting serves and what makes the offer different.
- Layer the positioning pillars into posts only when it serves the story—otherwise keep the focus on the broader narrative.
- Tone stays 100% personal; this brief is just the backdrop.

## Operational Notes
- Store future company guidelines in this folder so the repo remains the single source of truth agents can reference.
- Update this document when positioning, ICP, or proof points evolve. Mention the change in `AGENTS.md` so future sessions know to re-read.
