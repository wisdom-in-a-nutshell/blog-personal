# Writing Style — Blog Addendum

This file only covers blog-specific tweaks. The canonical voice, banned-word list, and punctuation rules live in the brand repo:
- Canonical voice: `/Users/adi/GitHub/adi-brand/adis_writing_style.md`

## Use This Blog-Specific Framing

- Founder/engineer POV talking to peers; confident, never salesy.
- Ground every idea in something real (numbers, incidents, or anecdotes) before abstracting to a takeaway.
- Keep momentum with short paragraphs; add bridges so sections flow.
- Close with a crisp takeaway or next experiment for the reader.

## Quick Reminders

- Follow banned words and punctuation rules in the canonical guide (no em dashes, avoid AI-ish verbs).
- Keep reader benefit explicit; state the “so what” early.
