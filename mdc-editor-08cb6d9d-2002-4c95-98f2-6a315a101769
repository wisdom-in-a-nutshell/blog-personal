## Writing Structure Guidelines

### Blog Post Structure

1. **Strong Introduction**
   - Begin with a compelling hook
   - Clearly state the post's purpose
   - Introduce main points early

2. **Body Content**
   - Use descriptive subheadings (H2, H3)
   - Include concrete examples and evidence
   - Break down complex concepts
   - Include personal anecdotes when appropriate

3. **Conclusion**
   - Wrap up with a final reflection or a call to action
   - Provide next steps or action items
   - End with a succinct conclusion that reinforces the main message without posing a question
